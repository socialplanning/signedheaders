This library allows trusted communication among HTTP and WSGI
applications that share a secret.

The add_signed_header function adds a header to a WSGI environment
which is signed with the shared secret.

The check_environ_signatures function searches the environment for
HTTP headers which end with _SIGNED.  If those headers are not signed
with the secret (or the signature is bad), they are removed.  If they
are signed, the signature is stripped, leaving the bare value.

This library requires that all applications have a (roughly)
synchronized clock.
